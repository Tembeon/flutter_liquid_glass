/// The iOS 27 calendar date picker: a month calendar in place.
///
/// UIKit: `UIDatePicker` with `.inline` and `.date`. SwiftUI: `DatePicker`
/// with `.graphical`. Flutter: `CalendarDatePicker`.
///
/// Its behaviour, keys and accessibility are [RawGlassDatePicker]'s: the
/// arrows turn the month with a slide, a tap on the month title turns the
/// day grid into month and year wheels (the title takes the accent color
/// at once and its chevron turns to point down over 0.25 s, as UIKit
/// does), and a tap on a day picks it. The picked day sits on a disc in
/// the label color, or in the accent when it is today, and today's number
/// takes the accent on a tinted disc; days outside [minimumDate] and
/// [maximumDate] fade. Texts come from [GlassLocalizations]. The calendar
/// follows the text scale up to [maxTextScale], except the day numbers,
/// which keep their size. It works with any renderer.
///
/// Focused from the keyboard, the title, an arrow or a day draws Flutter's
/// Cupertino focus ring inside it, and a mouse over one washes it as a
/// glass body's hover does (the rule of the glass controls; an
/// approximation, not measured). Each month grid is a layer of its own, so
/// a page turn moves recorded grids instead of painting every day again
/// (IDENTICAL).
