/// paint of their own: a wash across the whole surface that adds [wash] to
/// every color channel, and a soft spot under the finger, most at [center]
/// and fading as a Gaussian of standard deviation [radius]. Both stay
/// inside the surface's shape and under its content, and clamp at white.
/// How much the spot brightens is the glass's own: a renderer reads it from
/// the surface's glass with [gainOn]. The liquid renderer draws the glow in
/// its glass layer; the flat renderer, and the liquid one wherever it falls
