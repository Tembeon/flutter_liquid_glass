/// How a lifted lens shows what it selects, as iOS 27 does.
///
/// Read from UIKit's lifted tab bar and segmented control lenses on iOS
/// 27.2 (notes private). UIKit draws the selected look of the items over
/// the lens's glass and moves it away from the rim twice, each time along
/// a quarter circle that is strongest at the rim: first by the bend the
/// lens gives its content, 0.2 of its height over 0.16 of it
/// ([LensShadowLaw.contentBend]), then by the bend the lift adds,
/// [liftBend] over [liftBendHeight] on every lens. So the rim of a tab
/// bar's lens shows what lies 14 points inside it, 4.2 points deep shows
/// what lies 8.4 points deep, the nearest to the rim that ever shows, and
/// from 11.2 points deep everything shows in place. Both bends grow with
/// the lift.
///
/// What the bends show is parted with the glass under it: the lens parts
/// the colors of everything inside its rim by one law, [parting] at the rim
/// fading to nothing [partingDepth] deep, so a label that reaches the rim
/// spreads into its colors there the way the page behind the glass does.
