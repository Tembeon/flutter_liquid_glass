/// The package draws with `FlatGlassRenderer` (this library) and with
/// `LiquidGlassRenderer`, `FakeGlassRenderer` and `AdaptiveGlassRenderer`
/// (the `liquid` library). An app's own renderer extends this class with
/// public API only: [GlassSurfaceDetails] says what to draw; a frame's
/// [GlassShape.pathIn], or the shape's kinds ([GlassSuperellipse],
/// [GlassRoundedRect], [GlassOval]), and [GlassOutline.path] give the
/// body; [GlassFrame.drawnIn] and [GlassFrame.contentTransformIn] say
/// where it and its content go; [GlassFrame.glassnessAt] says how far a
/// lens has turned into glass.
///
/// A renderer builds a surface when the surface's widget rebuilds; frames
/// reach what it built through [GlassSurfaceDetails.frame], followed below
/// build, so a moving control rebuilds nothing per frame. Controls above
/// the surfaces keep their state across a switch, even mid-press.
