/// The iOS 27 compact date picker: a label that opens its picker in an
/// overlay.
///
/// UIKit: `UIDatePicker` with `.compact`. SwiftUI: `DatePicker` with
/// `.compact`. Flutter: `showDatePicker` and `showTimePicker`.
///
/// The label is a tinted capsule showing [value]; a touch dims its text,
/// and a tap opens the overlay out of it: a [GlassDatePicker] for a date,
/// the hour and minute wheels for a time. The overlay grows out of the
/// label's center on a spring while it fades in and reveals its content
/// from the label's side, hangs below the label (above it when there is no
/// room), and extends toward the leading side, on springs fitted to
/// UIKit's frames (replayed on an iPhone 16 Pro).
/// While it is open the label's text takes the accent color. Choosing a day
/// or turning a time wheel calls [onChanged] at once and the overlay stays
/// open; a tap outside or Escape closes it, turning an overlay that still
/// opens around. A tap on the label while the overlay closes opens a new
/// one after a shorter delay than a first open, as UIKit does, while the
/// old one finishes its close. With both labels, a tap on the other label
/// turns the open overlay into its picker.
///
/// In 12-hour time the wheels are the hour (1 to 12), the minute and AM/PM,
/// as UIKit lays them out; the hour wheel turning past 11 and 12 switches
/// AM and PM.
///
/// The texts come from [GlassLocalizations]. The label is a button and a
/// Tab stop; Space and Enter open it, and screen readers hear it expand. The
/// overlay is a dialog to screen readers, with a barrier that dismisses it;
/// it takes the focus at the picked day, and the focus returns to the label
/// when it closes. Focused from the keyboard, the label draws Flutter's
/// Cupertino focus ring, and a mouse over it washes it as a glass body's
/// hover does (an approximation, not measured). A disabled picker draws
/// its labels as text without their capsules and does not open.
///
/// The content fades inside the overlay's clip: NEAR (the clip's
/// anti-aliased edge row differs by up to 23 of 255 in the first frames
/// of the opening). The day grid (the time wheels) mounts on the frame
/// after the overlay's, while the overlay is still transparent, so the
/// open's layout spreads over two frames (IDENTICAL). A label dims under
/// the finger through the alpha of its text color instead of an opacity
/// layer: NEAR (one rounding instead of two, at most 1 of 255 per
/// channel, except where the anti-aliased edges of two glyphs share a
/// pixel, which a layer would cover once and the color covers twice).
