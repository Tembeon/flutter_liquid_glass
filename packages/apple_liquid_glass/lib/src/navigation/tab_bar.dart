/// stays on one line at
/// its size and ends in an ellipsis where it does not fit; UIKit first
/// tightens its tracking by up to 1.2 points, which this bar does not (NEAR).
/// Its motion is [RawGlassSelector]'s with

/// the tabs under it. Titles follow the text scale up to [maxTextScale].
/// [onDestinationSelected] runs on every selection, the selected tab's
/// included: a tap on it, Space, Enter or an accessibility tap reselects it,
/// where an app scrolls the tab's content to the top.

/// shrinks it into a 48 point circle that keeps its selected tab's glyph,

/// 0.8, response 0.3); the circle stays the same bar throughout, so the
/// morph turns around from wherever it is. A finger on the circle lifts it to
/// 64 points; lifted in place, however late, the finger expands the bar and
/// selects nothing; moved 4 points along the bar, it expands the bar and
/// carries the lens, and the tab under it on the lift is selected, as on
/// the expanded bar. The content's top end or a scroll past its far end also
/// expands it. Put it in a `GlassTabScaffold`.
///
