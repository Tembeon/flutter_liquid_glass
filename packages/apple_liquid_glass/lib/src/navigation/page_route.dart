/// An iOS 27 page pushed onto a navigator: it slides in over the page
/// below, which moves aside and dims under it.
///
/// UIKit: `UINavigationController.pushViewController(_:animated:)`.
/// SwiftUI: `NavigationLink`. Flutter: `CupertinoPageRoute`.
///
/// Without a finger the page slides on a critically damped spring of
/// response 0.3, leaving its start at 8.77 widths a second; the page below
/// moves aside by the width less 0.7 of it and dims under black at 10
/// percent, both with the page's progress; while they move, both pages are
/// cards with the display's corners and the top one casts UIKit's light
/// shadow (read from UIKit, notes private; device recordings). A finger
/// that drags the page toward the trailing side pops it as UIKit's
/// interactive pop does, from the leading edge (9 percent of the width)
/// after 15 points, or from anywhere else after 30 points within UIKit's
/// funnel, so drags and scrolls of the page's own that claim the touch
/// first keep it: the page follows the finger, rubber bands past either
/// end, and on release pops or returns as UIKit predicts from the finger's
/// last speeds, on a spring of response 0.3 and damping 0.85. With Prefer
/// Cross-Fade Transitions, which iOS turns on with Reduce Motion, a push or
/// pop without a finger cross-fades over 0.5 s instead.
/// Back, Escape and a screen reader's dismiss pop it through the page's
/// `PopScope`s; a pop asked for while a finger holds the page waits for
/// the release, which then takes the page out. Android's predictive back
/// slides a sliding page with the gesture, as a finger's swipe does, pops
/// it on commit and returns it on cancel; a page whose `PopScope` refuses
/// Back does not take the gesture.
///
/// The pages of a navigator share one `GlassNavigationBar`, drawn right
/// above the topmost glass page and under every route pushed after it, so
/// alerts, sheets and menus cover it; its capsules stay while the pages
/// move and change into the next page's as UIKit's do. The page follows
/// the finger one to one; UIKit's settings carry a
/// tracking spring whose use is not confirmed on the device. A finger does
/// not catch a page that is already leaving, as UIKit's does: the
/// navigator has popped it by then.
///
/// With a [source], the page zooms out of it instead, as a UIKit page with
/// `preferredTransition = .zoom` does: it grows from the source's frame to the
/// screen, center and width on a critically damped spring of response 0.317 and
/// height on one of response 0.406, damping 0.925, while the source's look
/// crossfades into it and the page underneath dims 15 percent under the growing
/// card's shadow; popped, it shrinks back into the source on UIKit's zoom-out
/// spring (iPhone 16 Pro recordings, replayed). A drag down or toward the
/// trailing side shrinks the page under the finger after 13.5 points, and a
/// release past 132.5 points or at 1050 points a second pops it into the
/// source; short of that it returns. The source hides while the page shows.
/// Without an attached source the page slides.
///

/// `CupertinoPageRoute`'s page is, named by [title], which screen readers
/// announce as it opens.
