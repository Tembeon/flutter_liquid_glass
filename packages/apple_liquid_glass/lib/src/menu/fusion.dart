/// morph container fuses them.
///
/// The container is one SDF layer whose elements, the menu shape and the
/// button shape, are united by a plain minimum (its smoothness is 0) and
/// whose distance field is blurred by a Gaussian of standard deviation
/// `MenuMotion.fusionRadius`. The blur pulls the facing edges into
/// points and joins the shapes by a neck while they are within a few
/// radii of each other; it also rounds and narrows each shape a little,
/// by about `radius^2 / (2 r)` on an edge of curvature radius `r`. Below
/// [minimumRadius] the blur moves no edge by more than a few hundredths
/// of a point and the silhouette is the plain union of the two shapes.
///
/// The fused outline is traced on a grid whose step grows with the
/// radius (a blurred field varies no faster than its blur), and the blur
/// is evaluated only near the edge: a blur of standard deviation `s`
/// moves a distance field by at most `1.26 s`, so farther from the edge
/// the sign, all the trace needs, is the unblurred one; inside the body
/// the blur reaches [shadedDepth] deeper, as far as a renderer shades
/// it. A body that is only filled (the flat renderer)
/// asks for the edge alone, which skips that deeper blur and the field a
/// renderer shades from. The last outline is reused while its inputs do
/// not change.
///
/// In profile and release builds that have isolates, a motion fuses its
/// next frame's silhouette ahead on a background isolate ([prefetch],
/// `FusionWorker`) while the current frame renders, and [outline]
/// serves that fusion when the frame's inputs are within
