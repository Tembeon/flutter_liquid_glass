/// The highlight of a tappable list row (UIKit `UITableViewCell` in a
/// table).
///
/// Inside a scroll view the highlight waits [touchDelay] after the touch
/// went down; a tap released sooner shows it at the release. It appears
/// at full strength, without a fade. A scroll that takes the touch removes
/// it at once. A tap's release fades it out over [fadeDuration] on
/// [fadeCurve]: UIKit keeps the tapped row selected until the app
/// deselects it, and this is `deselectRow(at:animated: true)`, the fade of
/// the standard tap handler.
///
/// As a [PointerFollower] it shows at the touch's arrival: a region inside
/// a scroll view delivers the touch once the scroll's delay has passed, or
/// at its release if that comes sooner.
///
/// Measured on the iOS 27.0 simulator (UITableView inset grouped, taps
/// and holds through XCUITest, 60 Hz): the delay is the scroll view's
/// `_touchDelayForScrollDetection`, 0.15 s, read from UIKit (notes
/// private), and the highlight showed 0.155 - 0.166 s after the touch (one
/// frame later); the fade is the CABasicAnimation UIKit adds, read from
/// the layer. Times are seconds.
