/// The motion of an iOS 27 sheet: its height between detents, its
/// translation while presenting and dismissing, how far it docks to the
/// screen edges and how much it dims what is behind it.
///
/// Heights are the sheet's unscaled heights in pixels, bottom safe area
/// included; the translation moves the sheet down from its resting place.
/// Presenting, dismissing and moving between detents ride
/// [SheetTuning.spring] (a flicked-away sheet
/// [SheetTuning.flickDismissSpring]) and carry velocity through every
/// retarget. A sheet resting below the large detent floats: it is the
/// full-width sheet scaled down so that it keeps
/// [SheetMotion.floatingInset] from the sides and the bottom. UIKit
/// docks it to the large detent as one transform interpolated by the
/// docking progress, the fraction of the height travelled between where
/// the transition started and the large detent (on the way back, between
/// the large detent and the floating one the sheet heads to); the scale,
/// the bottom corner radius ([bottomRadius]) and the opaque background
/// follow the same fraction. A move between two floating detents keeps the
/// sheet floating throughout.
///
/// The opaque fill that replaces the glass at the large detent follows
/// its own [SheetTuning.spring] toward the background of the detent
/// the sheet heads to: in a settle or a programmatic change it keeps pace
/// with the docking, while a drag switches it where the docking progress
/// crosses [SheetTuning.backgroundSwitch], so the glass gives way to
/// the fill at a point of the drag rather than along it.
///
/// A touch swells a floating sheet by [SheetTuning.pressScale] and
/// the swell holds through the drag the touch turns into. A drag moves
/// the sheet's top edge with the finger: between the smallest
/// and the largest detent the height follows it point for point, above
/// a floating largest detent it rubber-bands toward the maximum height
/// (at most [SheetTuning.stretchLimit]), a docked sheet does not
/// move up, and below the smallest the whole sheet slides down. A sheet
/// that floats when the drag begins stretches along
/// the drag with the finger's travel and its changes of speed
/// ([SheetTuning.stretchPerPoint]), keeping its area and its bottom
/// edge, and springs back on release.
/// Releasing above the smallest detent settles on the
/// detent nearest to the height projected by
/// [SheetTuning.projection]; releasing below it dismisses when the
/// projected slide passes half the sheet's visible height or the finger
/// moves faster than [SheetTuning.dismissVelocity], and returns
/// otherwise. The settle carries [SheetTuning.releaseVelocityGain]
/// times the finger's velocity. A tap on the grabber band cycles to the
/// next detent.
///
/// Height and offset rest within [MotionRest.length], the swell and the
/// stretch within [MotionRest.scale] of the sheet's longer side, the
/// sideways drift within [MotionRest.length] of the inset, the fill within
/// [MotionRest.opacity]: invisible, NEAR.
///
