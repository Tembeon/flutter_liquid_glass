/// The small liquid lens of a switch knob or a slider thumb.
///
/// A touch lifts it on a slightly bouncy spring (it grows and turns from
/// its solid platter into clear glass); the landing waits at least [hangTime]
/// after the lift, fades the glass back on a critically damped spring and
/// shrinks the lens on its own underdamped spring, so it dips below its
/// rest size before it settles. While it moves, the lens deforms by
/// UIKit's flex movement law for a loupe of its size
/// ([FlexSpec.loupeForSize]): speeding up it stretches along its
/// motion, squashes across it and its trailing edge lags ([shift]), each
/// eased into the loupe's movement bounds. Read from UIKit, notes
/// private; fed UIKit's own filtered motion, the law reproduces the
/// deformation UIKit records on switch knobs and slider thumbs to 1e-4 -
/// 4e-3 rms (device recordings).
///
/// The owner gives the lens position as a function of time and calls
/// [follow] whenever that course changes; the stretch filter steps once
/// per frame of [frameRate] in motion time, at the position of each
/// frame, until the lens is undeformed and the position still. UIKit's
/// filters weigh each frame the same whatever the frame rate, so the
/// stretch reacts twice as fast at 120 Hz as at 60 Hz. The outputs can be
/// read at any time.
///
/// The lift and size rest within a visible step; the deformation rests
/// once its filter is still, and comes to rest undeformed with the filter
/// primed at the position.
