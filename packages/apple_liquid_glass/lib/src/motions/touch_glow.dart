/// bar and open menu, which share the law and differ in [diameter],
/// [riseLag] and their peaks.
///
/// A touch raises both glows on a critically damped [riseSpring] after
/// [riseLag]; they hold while the finger stays down. A finger that moves
/// [dragDistance] from where it landed turns the spot into its dragging
/// state: twice as wide at half the strength, on [fallSpring]. Lifting
/// the finger lets both glows fall on [fallSpring] after [releaseLag]
/// while the spot spreads to [releaseGrowth] times its size. The spot
/// follows the finger.

/// Peaks come from the surface's [FlexSpec] - its big glow opacity
/// for the wash, its little glow opacity for the spot - so a 62 pixel
