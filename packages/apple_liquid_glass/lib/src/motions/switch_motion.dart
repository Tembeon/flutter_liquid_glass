/// The motion of an iOS 27 switch: knob, track color and knob lens.
///
/// A touch lifts the knob lens. A tap toggles on release: the knob
/// travels on a critically damped spring while the lens may still be
/// lifted, and the track color fades on its own spring, slower toward on
/// than toward off. A drag moves the knob with the finger, with a rubber
/// band past each end; a drag that starts moving within [deadZoneWindow]
/// of the touch first crosses a [deadZone]. The drag flips the state the
/// switch shows each time the finger has travelled more than
/// [flipDistance] toward the other state since the touch or the last
/// flip; the track color follows each flip after [colorDelay]. The
/// release keeps the shown state if the drag ever flipped it and toggles
/// like a tap otherwise.
///
/// Under Reduce Motion (the motion's [Motion.traits]) the knob never
/// lifts or grows and a drag holds it between the ends without the rubber
/// band; its travel
/// and the track color move as usual. Read from UIKit, notes private:
/// UISwitch lifts its knob only while pressed without Reduce Motion,
/// keeps the 37 x 24 knob size for a press under it, and clamps a dragged
/// knob instead of rubber-banding it.
///

///

/// to [onEvent] as the command that raises it runs.
