/// The behaviour cores of the controls: `RawGlassButton` (the button's),
/// `RawGlassSwitch`, `RawGlassSlider`, `RawGlassStepper`,
/// `RawGlassSelector`, `RawGlassPageControl`, `RawGlassSearchField`,
/// `RawGlassList`, `RawGlassListRow` and `RawGlassDatePicker`, with the
/// details each gives its builder; and `GlassSource`, through which a
/// control describes its body to a presentation that grows out of it.
///
/// For the author of a design system who wants iOS behaviour with a look
/// of their own. A core runs the measured motion of its control and takes
/// its input, focus, keys and semantics; it gives its builder where each
/// part of the control is and the control's states, and the builder
/// draws.
///
/// It promises that a frame of motion does not rebuild the builder: a
/// builder runs when the core builds, such as when its states change.
///
/// A core has no look of its own.
