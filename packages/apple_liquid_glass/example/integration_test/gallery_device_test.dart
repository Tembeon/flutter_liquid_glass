// The gallery's tour (test/gallery_test.dart) on a device's own engine and

//
// On Linux the engine draws with Impeller's OpenGL ES backend, the one an
// Android device without a usable Vulkan driver falls back to. It draws
// into one color attachment a pass, gives a texture one filter for all its
// samplers and aborts the process on what it cannot encode, so glass that
// only Metal and Vulkan draw fails here:
//
// flutter create --platforms linux .
// xvfb-run flutter test integration_test/gallery_device_test.dart -d linux
//   --enable-impeller --enable-flutter-gpu
