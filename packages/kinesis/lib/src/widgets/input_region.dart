/// Turns pointer, keyboard, hover and accessibility input into the input
/// of its [interactions].
///
/// UIKit: a control's touch tracking with its gesture recognizers. SwiftUI:
/// a view's gestures. Flutter: `RawGestureDetector` with `Focus`,
/// `MouseRegion` and `Semantics`.
///
/// Every event of a touch the region follows is stamped on the clock of the
/// nearest [MotionClockScope] at its own time stamp, the release included,
/// and the release carries the velocity of the base `VelocityTracker`
/// estimated with the release's own sample, so a live drag ends as its
/// replay does. The region joins the
/// gesture arena only for touches an interaction accepts, so one that
/// takes nothing never blocks a scroll, and it holds or gives up a touch as
/// its [InteractionSession] decides, including the scroll delay of a
/// control inside a scroll view. When an interaction [Interaction.activates]
/// (a press, a tap), the accessibility tap and the `ActivateIntent` and
/// `ButtonActivateIntent` of the app's shortcuts activate it: Space and
/// Enter under a `WidgetsApp`, as for Flutter's own buttons. An app remaps
/// the keys with `Shortcuts` and replaces what activation does with an
/// `Actions` above the region, since the region's actions are
/// `Action.overridable`. A region activates only while its own focus node
/// has the primary focus: in a region inside another (a switch in a
/// pressable row), the focused inner region handles Space and Enter, and
/// the outer one only when it is focused itself; an override above both
/// hears the inner region's activation. When an interaction
/// [Interaction.adjusts] (a
/// slider, a stepper), the region binds the keys of
/// [AdjustValueIntent.defaultShortcuts] around its focus and gives
/// accessibility increase and decrease; both arrive as [AdjustInput]s, and
/// only those its [adjustRange] allows are offered. A region registers an
/// action only for what one of its interactions takes, so a region that
/// neither activates nor adjusts (a drag region around a row of focusable
/// items) leaves Space, Enter and the value keys to the focus below it.
///
/// The other interactions hear each event of a touch on the pointer's
/// route, where Flutter's gesture recognizers hear it, so a recognizer
/// inside the region (a scroll view in a sheet) that passes its slop on
/// the same event as a drag of the region takes the touch, as it would
/// from a recognizer around it. An interaction of the
/// [InteractionRole.observer] role hears every touch it accepts at once
/// and to its end, outside the gesture arena, as the event reaches the
/// region, as a `Listener` does: before the recognizers inside hear it. A
/// control that must follow a finger another gesture may win (a hold that
/// opens a menu over a button) observes it.
///
/// A region none of whose interactions [Interaction.takesPointers] is
/// transparent to pointers, its child included, as under `IgnorePointer`,
/// and keeps its focus, keys and semantics.
///
/// Presses of the secondary button reach the interactions that accept them
/// (`SecondaryClickInteraction`). When an interaction
/// [Interaction.opensContextMenu], the region binds
/// [ContextMenuIntent.defaultShortcuts] (the context menu key, Shift+F10)
/// around its focus and turns the intent into a [ContextMenuInput] at its
/// centre, under the same focus rule as activation. The scroll wheel
/// reaches them as
/// [PointerScrollInput]s when one [Interaction.takesWheel], and the region
/// then keeps it from the scroll views around it.
///
/// With a [port] it also hears the touches another region hands on to it
/// (`InputPort.forward`), mapped into its own coordinates. It writes
/// pressed, hovered, focused, dragged and disabled into [statesController]
/// (focused only while the focus should show: when the keyboard was used
/// last, as `InkWell` does, so a tap that focuses lights no ring), and
/// plays the haptic [feedback] picks for each event as it happens;
/// keyboard and accessibility inputs play none.
