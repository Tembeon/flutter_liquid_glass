/// Flutter: a global route on the `PointerRouter`. A menu takes a touch
/// made between the tap that opens it and its opening this way.
///
/// While armed it takes every new touch of the primary button, one at a
/// time, and runs it through its interactions exactly as an `InputRegion`
/// runs a touch that landed in it: every event stamped on the clock of the
/// nearest [MotionClockScope] at its own time stamp, the timed reactions on
/// that clock, and the haptic its `feedback` picks for each event the
/// interactions raise. Positions are global, and the touch's region is the
/// whole view. The capture stays out of the gesture arena: what lies under
/// the finger hears the touch as well, and a claim takes nothing from it.
