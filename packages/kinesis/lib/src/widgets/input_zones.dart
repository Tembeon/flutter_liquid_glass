/// Touch: a pointer that lands on a zone (its rect, or its extension to

/// finger that rests on a moving zone stays inside it. Touches are stamped,
/// heard and taken to the gesture arena exactly as an `InputRegion`'s are:
/// one mechanism serves both. With [slides], a finger that moves onto
/// another zone moves the touch there: the zone it leaves gets a cancel,
/// the zone it enters a down at the finger, and [feedback] hears a
/// `ScrubChangeEvent` with the new zone; the touch then ends where the
/// finger lifts. This is how an alert's actions, a menu's rows and a tab
/// bar's items are scrubbed. With a [port], touches handed on from another
/// region arrive the same way, also onto no zone at first. The host's own
/// [interactions] hear each touch on the host whole, from down to up,
/// wherever the finger goes, and ask [InputZonesController.zoneAt] what
/// lies under it.
///
/// Mouse: each zone has its own cursor and hovered state, and hears hover
/// as `PointerHoverInput`s; a zone that moves under a resting mouse is
/// entered and left with the next frame. The secondary button and the
/// scroll wheel reach a zone's interactions that take them.
///
/// Focus: each zone has a focus node, made and disposed with the zone. A
/// zone can take focus while it is [InputZone.focusable] and takes input
/// now, and is a focus target for the keys while an interaction also
/// activates or adjusts. With [stops] at [InputZoneStops.each], Tab visits
/// the targets in the order of [zones] (other focusable widgets inside
/// [child] come after them); at [InputZoneStops.one] the host is a single
/// stop that Tab enters at [current] or at the zone focused last. Assistive
/// technology reaches every zone that can take focus either way. The arrows
/// move between targets: along [axis] in the order of [zones], mirrored in
/// right-to-left for a horizontal axis, or to the nearest zone on screen
/// when [axis] is null; Home and End reach the first and the last target.
/// With [activatesOnMove], the zone an arrow, Home or End moves to is also
/// activated, as a keyboard activation: a selection that follows focus. An
/// arrow with no zone in its direction (past the last one, or across
/// [axis]) asks [onEdge], then moves focus as Flutter's directional focus
/// does, which may leave the host. A zone whose interaction adjusts keeps
/// the arrows, Home and End for its value
/// (`AdjustValueIntent.defaultShortcuts`). Space and Enter activate the
/// focused zone through `ActivateIntent`, and the context menu key and
/// Shift+F10 open the context menu of a focused zone that has a secondary
/// click (`ContextMenuIntent`, at the zone's centre), which an app
/// overrides with `Actions` above the host, as for `InputRegion`; a region
/// around the host does not take them from a focused zone.
///
/// Semantics: each zone that is [InputZoneFrame.live] is one semantics
/// node over its hit rectangle, which follows [frameOf], with its label,
/// value, flags, enabled state, tap, increase and decrease, and focus. The
/// semantics of [child] are dropped unless [excludeChildSemantics] is
/// false, since the zones describe what the child paints.
///
/// Each zone is a render box of its hit rectangle's size, placed on the
/// zone by the host's paint transform: tests and tools find a zone where it
/// is painted (`tester.tap(find.bySemanticsLabel('Edit'))` taps it), and
/// its focus node reports its rectangle. A frame in which the zones only
/// move rebuilds and lays out nothing: the host refreshes the zones'
/// semantics and focus state, and the transform is read when a hit test,
/// the semantics or the focus ask. A zone that appears or changes size
/// lays out its own box alone (each is its own relayout boundary) at the
/// start of the next frame; until then the transform scales the box to the
/// zone, and a box still empty reports the zone's bounds to semantics and
/// focus.
