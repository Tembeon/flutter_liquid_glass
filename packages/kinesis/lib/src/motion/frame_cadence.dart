/// Which of a fast display's vsyncs the app draws on.
///
/// On a display faster than 60 Hz the app draws every second vsync (about 60
/// frames a second) unless something fast moves: a scroll or a finger past
/// [fullSpeed], or a `Motion` with a higher floor, such as a sheet. Everything
/// on the screen moves in one frame, so glass never lags what lies under it.
/// A display at 90 Hz or less draws every vsync. [enabled] turns it off.
///
/// Nothing runs until [start]. It sees a scroll only when told through
/// [scrolled], and a scroll nobody reports stays at the lower rate, so whoever
/// calls [start] reports the scrolls of the app.
///
/// When the device cannot keep up with the full rate, it stays at the lower
/// one for a while, longer each time, as a phone that misses every other
/// frame looks worse than a phone at a steady 60.
///
/// Fidelity: NEAR. UIKit picks a scroll's rate from its speed in device
/// pixels: 48 Hz up to about 180 - 240 px/s, 60 up to 400 - 480, 80 up to 720
/// - 960, 120 up to 4560 - 4800 and 80 above (read from UIKit, notes
/// private), and its dynamic-spec channels, sheet bodies included, publish at
/// 60 Hz (iPhone 16 Pro, iOS 27.0.1). Skipping vsyncs reaches only 120 and
/// 60: slow motion runs at 60 rather than 48, and the two bands at 80 run at
/// 60 or 120, split at [fullSpeed] and left at 120 above 4800 px/s.
