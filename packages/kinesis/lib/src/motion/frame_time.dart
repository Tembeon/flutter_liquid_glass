/// A frame's time is its frame time stamp (so `timeDilation` and test pumps
/// apply), put on the display's frame grid ([FrameGrid]). While the clock
/// dozes or sleeps, the wait counts where the frame time stamps follow the
/// engine clock, as on a device: input stamped and changes made meanwhile
/// get the time an uninterrupted clock would give them, and so does the
/// frame that ends the wait, so a finger held still keeps its time. Under a
/// test's fake frame clock, which the engine clock does not follow, the time
/// stands still while the clock sleeps.
///
/// Input events are stamped at their own time stamp, moved onto the frame
/// clock by the pointer clock offset: UIKit's measured delays count from
/// the touch's time stamp. While the clock runs or dozes, an event's time is
/// the latest frame's time plus the time from that frame's time stamp to
/// the event's, usually a frame or two in the past. Events that arrive
/// before its first frame, or while it sleeps under a fake frame clock,
/// keep their spacing, measured by their own time stamps and slowed by
/// `timeDilation`, and the first frame after the wake continues from the
/// latest of them, so the clock never runs backwards. An event whose time
/// stamp does not land within [maxEventAge] before the engine clock is
/// taken as happening one frame after its delivery. When the frame time
/// stamps and the engine clock disagree by more than [maxFrameLead] (a
/// test's fake frame clock), an event gets the latest frame's time while
/// the clock runs, and the first frame after a wake continues from the
/// latest stamp itself.
