/// The motion kernel: springs, values that move on them, the clock they
/// move by, and motions written as pure classes.
///
/// For the author of motion: a control's law, a presentation's or any
/// other is a `Motion` (a tree of parts such as `Ramp`, `MotionLoop`,
/// `Band`, `MotionRect`, `Presence`, `LayoutMotion` and `Projection`) that
/// replays a recorded gesture exactly, without a widget tree. `Spring`
/// takes both UIKit forms and knows when it comes to rest; `MotionValue`
/// moves on springs; `withSpring` and `withoutAnimation` say how the
/// changes made inside them move; `MotionSelection` derives values; the
/// clock and `FrameCadence` say when frames happen.
///
/// It promises that motion is a function of its time-stamped inputs: every
/// command takes the time it happens at and every read answers at the
/// motion's time. A retarget keeps position and velocity, so an
/// interruption never jumps. At rest it asks for no frames. Reduce Motion
/// reaches every motion through one channel, `Motion.traits`.
///
/// It never imports widgets or rendering, and never decides what is drawn.
