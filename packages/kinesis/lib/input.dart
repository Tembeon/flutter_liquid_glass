/// Gestures as pure logic: interactions, their combinations, the handoff of
/// a touch between regions, and time-stamped input events.
///
/// For the author of a control: an `Interaction` (press, tap, long press,
/// drag, scrub, follow, secondary click, hover dwell) takes
/// `InteractionInput`s and answers with `InteractionEvent`s, so a gesture
/// is checked by replaying a recording, with no screen. `InputPort` hands
/// a touch from one region to another.
///
/// It promises one way to stamp an event with its time, and that keyboard
/// and accessibility commands (`ActivateInput`, the value commands of
/// `AdjustInput`, the keyboard's request for a context menu,
/// `ContextMenuInput`), the secondary button and the scroll wheel
/// (`PointerScrollInput`) arrive on the same path as touches.
///
/// It never knows about widgets, focus or semantics, and imports neither
/// widgets nor rendering.
